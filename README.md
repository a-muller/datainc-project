# datainc-project
This is my proposal for the Data Incubator Project.

Hard drives disks are massively used in data storage centers. Disks failures can be costly as those disks have to be replaced.

Backblaze provides such data storage and monitors every hard drive daily.

By looking closely at Backblaze's datasets, we want to answer the following questions :

- what are the most reliable hard drives out there ?

- can we predict hard drives failures in advance ?
